        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
          Total knee replacement (TKR), also known as total knee arthroplasty, is one of the most successful and commonly performed orthopaedic procedures worldwide. It is done to relieve pain and restore function in patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or post traumatic joint degeneration. TKR has evolved a lot in the past years. There have been advances in implant design, surgical robots, and also navigation systems, but the end goal has always been to <strong>achieve optimal soft tissue balancing</strong> to ensure accurate and enhanced surgical outcomes. Intraoperative soft tissue tension directly influences joint kinematics, stability, and patient satisfaction, and imbalance in these tissues often leads to complications such as pain, stiffness, instability, or early implant failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intraoperative soft tissue tension, especially in the medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), exert a lot of influence on the biomechanics of the joint, and the kinematics and longevity of the implant. When there is an imbalance present in the knee, patients may experience persistent pain, joint instability or stiffness, dissatisfaction, premature wear of the prosthetic, and early revision surgery. This is a major challenge in achieving good TKR outcomes. With hundreds of thousands of TKR procedures performed annually around the world, the clinical and economic stakes are high, thus making soft tissue balancing not just a technical nuance but a core determinant of success.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
        <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
          The knee is a complex join comprising of the distal femur (thigh bone), the proximal tibia (shin bone), and the patella (knee cap). The 2 main bones are the femur and tibia (as shown in image 1). They are covered by cartilage and supported by menisci. Knee stability is provided by the three main ligaments (MCL, LCL, PCL). In a healthy, non-diseased knee, these structures work together to allow flexion and extension of the knee with balanced ligament tension and proportionate load distribution <em>(MBA, 2019)</em>.

        <p>
          When degenerative disease such as osteoarthritis alters this anatomy, the knee becomes painful, stiff, deformed (varus or valgus), and mobility becomes limited. At the point where conservative therapies (medications, injections, physical therapy, and lifestyle modification) no longer provide relief, TKR becomes unavoidable.
        </p>
        <p>
          TKR is most commonly performed in adults between <strong>45 and 80 years old</strong>, which is the age range in which degenerative joint disease becomes symptomatic and limits functionality. The procedure is notably more common in <strong>females</strong>, who have a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis due to anatomical, hormonal, and biomechanical factors. Additional high-risk groups include patients with <strong>diabetes, obesity, and those with a family history of osteoarthritis</strong>, all of which substantially increase cartilage degeneration and worsen joint inflammation. Patients with a history of <strong>previous knee injuries</strong>—such as ligament tears, fractures, or meniscal damage—also tend to develop earlier-onset post-traumatic arthritis, often requiring TKR at a younger age. These demographic trends highlight the broad and growing population that depends on successful knee replacement outcomes.
        </p>

        </image-component>
        <p>
          The TKR procedure removes the damaged bone surfaces (as seen in Image: 03) and replaces them with prosthetic components (implants), to restore alignment and stability. These implants come in various sizes depending on the patient’s physicality and deformity severity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic workflow of the surgical procedure is shown below.

        <h3>1.2 Significance</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Soft tissue tensioning</strong> refers to the process of balancing the ligaments in the knee during TKR to ensure that the alignment outcomes post-surgery are as similar to the native knee of the patient pre-surgery. In the workflow above, steps 4, 7, and 9 aim to achieve this soft tissue balancing through knee assessment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most critical determinants of successful outcomes in TKR is the achievement of proper soft tissue balance. During surgery, the medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) must be tensioned appropriately to ensure joint stability and natural kinematics throughout the range of motion. However, current balancing techniques are largely subjective and rely on the surgeon’s tactile feedback and experience. This dependence introduces significant variability between surgeons and cases, contributing to inconsistent outcomes and a steep learning curve for less experienced surgeons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emerging technologies such as computer-assisted navigation and robotic systems have attempted to address this variability, yet they often lack real-time quantitative data on soft tissue tension. Consequently, there remains a pressing clinical need for an intraoperative solution that can provide objective, real-time feedback on ligament forces to help surgeons achieve personalized and reproducible soft tissue balance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-2-header-1">
        <h3>1.2.1 Clinical Significance</h3>
        <p>
          The clinical significance of soft tissue balancing in TKR cannot be overstated. Surgeons currently manage knee balance by using a variety of alignment strategies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mechanical alignment</strong>, aiming to restore a neutral mechanical axis of the limb, i.e., restore a straight knee with 0° deviation from the axis.</li>
          <li><strong>Kinematic alignment</strong>, attempting to respect the patient’s native joint line and soft tissue envelope. This has proved to have the best outcomes due to the importance given to soft tissue balancing in restoring the native knee.</li>
          <li><strong>Hybrid approaches</strong>, combining elements of both depending on patient anatomy or surgeon philosophy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During surgery, knee assessment for soft tissue balancing usually involves the surgeon applying a varus-valgus stress in order to check the gaps in the medial and lateral compartment. They check the laxity in each side, and may perform some soft tissue release if they feel it is necessary. However, this process is largely based on the surgeon’s tactile experience, visual cues, and judgement, and hence experience and training is extremely important in TKR cases. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Proper soft tissue balance is fundamental to <em>(Wu et al., 2025)</em>: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Joint stability:</strong> An unbalanced knee may feel unstable or give way during daily activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Even load distribution:</strong> Asymmetrical loading of the implant and bone can increase wear and tear.</li>
          <li><strong>Assess medial and lateral compartment laxities:</strong> Lateral compartment has more laxity than the medial compartment, which leads to different gap values for each compartment.</li>
          <li><strong>Range of motion and function:</strong> Over-tight ligaments may restrict flexion, and overly lax ligaments may reduce extension or cause instability.</li>
          <li><strong>Patient comfort and satisfaction:</strong> Many patients report dissatisfaction due to persistent pain, stiffness, or a “foreign” feeling knee even when the implant is well aligned.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term implant survival:</strong> Studies suggest soft tissue imbalance may account for a significant proportion of early revisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given that 10-20 % of patients remain dissatisfied <em>(Bourne et al., 2010)</em> and many early failures may be linked to soft tissue imbalance, improving the reproducibility and quantification of soft tissue tension intra-operatively is critical for improving outcomes.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-sub-section-1-header-2-header-2">
        <h3>1.2.2 Market Significance</h3>
        <p>
          Given the ageing global population, rising incidence of obesity, and higher functional demands of patients, the volume of TKR continues to escalate. Currently there are about 3.6 million TKR surgeries <em>(Deshpande et al., 2016)</em> done worldwide per year (Leung et al., 2018).

        <h2>2. Problem Clarification</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the high procedural success and widespread adoption of TKR, the patient satisfaction rates are still considered to be significantly low. TKR is reported to have only <stong>80% satisfaction rates</stong> <em>(Bourne et al., 2010)</em>, which amounts to about 660,000 dissatisfied patients yearly. Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a surgery that is done in a very similar method to TKR, yet, the satisfaction for THR were reported to be 90%. This discrepancy occurs due to a number of factors, however, the main contributor is the challenge of intraoperative soft tissue balancing in knee replacement.

        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Reasons for low satisfaction rates after TKR </strong><em>(Dhrupad Ponnamaneni et al., 2024)</em>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Poor knee alignment due to soft tissue imbalance:</strong> Under-tensioning or over-tensioning the ligaments leads to instability, stiffness, or unnatural knee kinematics, which makes the joint feel unstable or “not like my own.” Even small imbalances can significantly affect pain, function, and long-term implant success. (35% of total dissatisfaction cases; shown in pie chart below) <em>(Sun et al., 2022)</em></li>

          <li><strong>Unrealistic expectations:</strong> Some patients anticipate a completely “normal” knee or rapid recovery, leading to disappointment when outcomes don’t match expectations. Mismatch between perceived and actual functional improvement is a major driver of dissatisfaction.</li>

          <li><strong>Psychological and social factors:</strong> Anxiety, depression, low pain tolerance, or inadequate social support can negatively influence perceived recovery and overall satisfaction. These factors often magnify discomfort and slow functional progress.</li>

          <li><strong>Post-surgery complications:</strong> Issues such as infection, stiffness, persistent pain, or instability reduce trust in the surgical outcome. Even minor complications can significantly lower satisfaction despite technically successful surgery.</li>

          <li><strong>Post-surgery care:</strong> Incomplete rehabilitation, poor adherence to physiotherapy, or inadequate follow-up can delay functional recovery. Insufficient guidance during the recovery period often contributes more to dissatisfaction than the surgery itself.</li>

        <h3>2.1. Clinical Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          It has been established that the main reason for dissatisfaction is <strong>improper soft tissue balancing during surgery</strong>.
          This implies that the current surgical procedure has some major shortcomings.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Issues with current TKR procedure:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Knee assessment is very surgeon-guided and subjective </strong><em>(Corbett et al., 2025)</em>:
            <ul>
              <li>Soft tissue balancing relies heavily on a surgeon’s tactile experience, visual inspection, and “feel,” leading to significant variability between surgeons.</li>
              <li><strong>Different surgeons apply different magnitudes of force when testing ligament tension</strong>, making outcomes inconsistent and difficult to standardize.</li>
              <li>Even within the same surgeon, force application can vary across procedures due to fatigue, perception, or intraoperative conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            </image-component>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>No personalised system to determine the ideal force:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Every patient’s knee ligament stiffness is unique, and thus the ideal amount of force applied to every knee is also unique.</strong></li>
              <li>There cannot be one force value that can be applied to every knee; a personalised system is required to determine each patient’s “ideal force.”</li>
            </ul>

            </image-component>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>No measurable and reproducible force applied during gap assessment:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Manual force application creates wide variability in measured gaps. The same knee may appear “balanced” or “unbalanced” depending on the force used.</li>
              <li>Without objective force control, surgeons cannot reliably reproduce the same conditions across the extension and flexion arcs or between knees.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Existing tensioner devices disrupt workflow and lack compatibility:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>They add additional steps to the workflow, which is inconvenient for the surgeon.</li>
              <li>Digital tensioning devices available today are typically tied to specific robotic or navigation platforms, limiting their use to certain systems and institutions.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Review of Existing Tensioners</h3>
        <p>
          To identify areas for improvement in current soft-tissue balancing and tensioning devices used in Total Knee Replacement (TKR), a review of existing tools and technologies was conducted.
          The goal was to evaluate their functionality, accuracy, usability, and ability to deliver personalised, reproducible soft-tissue balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The findings reveal that while multiple solutions exist across manual, mechanical, sensor-based, and robotic categories, none fully address the need for real-time, patient-specific ligament tension measurement before bone cuts.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The existing tensioners can be broadly classified into 3 main categories</strong> <em>(Wu et al., 2025)</em>:</p>

        <h3>2.3. Interview Insights</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted <strong>35 interviews</strong> with orthopaedic surgeons and industry professionals, and there was strong consensus across most responses.
          We asked questions to gain insights on soft tissue balancing and personalised force in gap assessment. Most surgeons agreed that achieving proper
          soft tissue balance remains one of the most <strong>subjective and variable</strong> aspects of TKR.
        </p>

        <p>
          All surgeons acknowledged that <strong>balanced ligaments</strong> are critical for joint stability and patient satisfaction. However, there is
          currently <strong>no standardized method</strong> for quantifying soft tissue tension intra-operatively. Most rely on tactile “feel,” visual cues,
          and personal experience to judge when tension is “just right.” They emphasized that this feel-based method causes significant <strong>variability in outcomes</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The surgeons used different alignment approaches — mechanical alignment, kinematic alignment, or
          hybrid alignment — depending on patient anatomy and case complexity. Several surgeons noted that <strong>poor soft tissue balancing</strong>,
          rather than misalignment alone, is a major cause of postoperative stiffness, instability, and patient dissatisfaction. Most preferred
          <strong>robotic TKR</strong> over conventional TKR due to improved accuracy and faster surgeries.
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked about balance assessment tools, most surgeons still rely on conventional instruments such as laminar spreaders,
          spacer blocks, and gap balancers, while only a few use force sensors or digital tensioners. All interviewees agreed
          that there is currently <strong>no gold standard</strong> for measuring ligament tension intra-operatively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Several expressed interest in a <strong>quantitative, real-time feedback system</strong> to improve reproducibility, though others cautioned that
          soft tissue balance is inherently patient- and surgeon-specific. However, the consensus was that if a device could <strong>quantify varus–valgus force</strong>,
          it would not only improve patient satisfaction but also <strong>reduce the learning curve</strong> for junior surgeons through increased standardization.

        <h3>2.4. Key Pain Points</h3>
        <p>
          Based on our interview and survey findings, we narrowed down the problem to the following pain points for surgeons:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>No personalised force:</strong> This was a major concern across most surgeons. Every patient's knee is different, and every surgeon applies a different force when assessing knee gaps.
            Currently, no one knows the <em>“ideal force”</em> for each knee. This <strong>“ideal force” is patient specific</strong>, and varies based on the patient's BMI and deformity severity. There is no current way to know or measure this personalized force. 
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Lack of objectivity:</strong> Surgeons’ body type and strength vary, so the force applied during gap assessment is inconsistent. For example, a petite surgeon may apply less force than a larger surgeon. Force is currently based on “feel,” and standardizing it is necessary for consistency in gap assessment.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Lack of replicability:</strong> No device currently enables reproducible force application. Once the force is objectified based on patient specificity, it can be consistently replicated when testing implants. This reproducible force will better mimic the native knee environment before bone cuts and enable improved gap balancing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Low patient satisfaction:</strong> Satisfaction for Total Hip Replacement is 90%, while Total Knee Replacement is only 80%. Surgeons believe improving soft tissue balancing can help increase satisfaction rates.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Long training hours:</strong> Measuring soft tissue tension could reduce the learning curve for junior surgeons performing TKR, allowing them to learn faster and more consistently.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.5 Needs Statement</h3>
        <p>
          After analysing the problem, our project aims:
        </p>

        <p>
          To develop a method to produce a <strong>personalised gap (±0.5 mm)</strong> intra-operatively during primary Total Knee Replacement,
          based on native lateral and medial cruciate ligament tension (<strong>50–250N</strong>), empowering surgeons to achieve
          <strong>reproducible balance</strong>, allowing junior surgeons to shorten their learning curve, and enabling patients to experience
          more <strong>natural alignment</strong>, thereby improving <strong>patient satisfaction (90%)</strong>.

        <h3>3. Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>
          Our device offers a unique, <strong>data-driven approach to soft tissue balancing</strong> in Total Knee Replacement, providing surgeons with <strong>quantitative measurements</strong> of the force experienced by the joint during gap assessment rather than relying on subjective feel or visual cues. This enables <strong>personalized, reproducible knee balance</strong> tailored to each patient’s native anatomy—something existing tensioners and spacer blocks cannot achieve. By integrating seamlessly into both manual and robotic workflows, it empowers surgeons of all experience levels to achieve consistent, high-quality outcomes, <strong> variability, shortening the learning curve, and driving patient satisfaction to 90%.</strong>

        <p>
          The primary users of this intraoperative ligament tension measurement device are orthopaedic surgeons performing total knee replacements (TKR). These surgeons directly interact with the device during surgery to achieve precise, personalised soft-tissue balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondary stakeholders — such as hospitals (buyers, procurement decision-makers) and patients (beneficiaries of improved outcomes) — influence adoption indirectly through purchasing and clinical outcomes data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The surgeon market can be further segmented by current balancing practice and robotic system usage, identifying where unmet needs and adoption potential are highest.
        </p>
        <p>The table below explains that surgeons who do not use tensioners but use robotic systems fall under the category of non users. Yet, they are part of our targe audience since our device will convince them to start using tensioners when it proves to produce better soft tssue balancing. </p>

          We then used the Need Criteria Evaluation Matrix and the Pugh Matrix for concept screening to come up with 1 final concept.

          The highest scoring concept was the one that involved the <strong>mechanical jack system</strong> because of its ease of measuring
          the force and displacement using a screw jack system.
        </p>

        <p>Given below is an overview of the selected concept:</p>

        <h2>4.5. Concept Logic</h2>
        <p>
          Through all the concepts shown above, although there are many possible embodiments for the different functional requirements, this section focuses more on the “algorithm” functional requirement to better understand the logic that our device follows. We established that there are 3 main requirements: measure force, measure displacement, cue the surgeon when ideal force has been reached. In order to do this, we have two ideas as explained below.
      </div>

      <div id="sub-sub-section-4-header-5-header-1">
        <h2>4.5.1. Force Displacement Curve (Logic 1)</h2>
        <p>
          This concept works on the basis of a force-displacement curve. Ligaments in the knee behave like elastic materials, meaning they stretch under load and follow predictable elastic behaviour until they reach a point of yielding. When a ligament is gradually tensioned, the relationship between the applied force and the resulting displacement forms a <strong>force–displacement curve</strong>. In the early region of the curve, the ligament stretches elastically, and force increases gradually with displacement. As the ligament approaches its elastic limit, the curve begins to flatten, leading to a <strong>point of inflection</strong>, also known as the<strong> yielding point</strong>. Beyond this point, the ligament enters the plastic region where permanent damage or over-stretching can occur <em>(Chantarapanich Beng et al., 2009)</em>.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="fyp images\forc disp curve.png"
          subtitle="Image 33: Force Displacement Curve"
          style="display:block; width:400px; height:auto; margin: 0 auto;">
        </image-component>
        <p>
          The goal of soft-tissue balancing is to tension the ligaments safely within their elastic region, without allowing the surgeon to approach or exceed the yielding point. The “ideal force” to be applied by a surgeon is considered to be approximately 10% before the yielding point force. This ensures that the ligament is sufficiently tensioned for stability, but not overstressed. When the surgeon reaches this optimal force threshold, the device will provide an immediate signal to stop applying additional force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since ligament stiffness and elasticity vary widely between individuals <em>(Readioff et al., 2020)</em>, the force–displacement curve will be different for every patient. By measuring both force and displacement intra-operatively, our device can generate each patient’s personalised curve in real time. This creates a <strong>customised, objective feedback system</strong> that guides the surgeon to the optimal tension unique to that patient, improving precision and reducing risks associated with over- or under-tensioning.
        </p>
        <p>However, this method has some <strong>risks and concerns</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Due to the complex biomechanics of the knee, the graph will not be perfectly linear before the point of inflection.
            How do we go about finding the yield point if the slope is changing even before the point of inflection? <em>(Buhary et al., 2019)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to know the force value 10% before the yielding point, we need to know the yielding point.
            However, if the force reaches the yielding point that would mean the ligament has already crossed its maximum limit.
            Is this damage significant?
          </li>
          <li>
            We have some preliminary answers based on surgeon feedback, which suggests that it is acceptable to go just beyond the yield point
            because it is considered very mild damage. This is something we hope to investigate further before reaching a proper conclusion.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-sub-section-4-header-5-header-2">
        <h2>4.5.2. Balance Solver Method (Logic 2)</h2>
        <p>
          Another method we explored for determining the optimal soft-tissue tension is the <strong>Balance Solver Method</strong>,
          which leverages the elastic behaviour of ligaments under loading. When a controlled force is applied to a ligament, it elongates,
          but once the force is removed, the ligament returns to its original length — as long as the force remains within the elastic region.
          This reversible stretch continues until the ligament approaches its<strong> yielding point</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, when the applied force <strong>exceeds</strong> this yielding point, the ligament enters the plastic region. In this region, the tissue
          does not fully return to its original length after the force is released, indicating a small but measurable amount of permanent stretch.
          This irreversible change becomes a useful marker: it reveals that the applied force has crossed the safe limit for that ligament.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Balance Solver Method uses this principle by incrementally applying tension and then releasing it to observe whether the ligament
          fully recoils. The point at which the ligament fails to return to its original length is identified as the <strong>yielding point</strong>. Once this
          threshold is detected, the system calculates the ideal force as <strong>10% below the yielding force</strong>, consistent with established
          soft-tissue safety guidelines.
        </p>

        <p>
          By repeatedly applying and releasing small controlled forces, the Balance Solver Method can determine the yielding point without
          overstressing the ligament and without requiring continuous high-force loading. This enables a safe, personalised, and objective
          measurement of each patient’s optimal tension level and provides a clear signal to the surgeon when the ideal force is reached.

        <h2>5. Prototypig Plan</h2>
        <p>
          Although we have ranked the different concepts and selected to go ahead with the mechanical jack concept, we are choosing to prototype the other solutions as well to see if another combination of functional requirements work better than the one we have selected. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed solutions, three concept designs are selected for initial prototyping. Each concept explores a different mechanical approach to achieving accurate and personalized soft tissue balancing during TKR, allowing us to compare their functionality, precision, and integration potential in a surgical setting. This section further discusses those designs, before talking about our plan for how we are going to go about prototyping.

        <h2>5.1. Specifications</h2>
        <p>
          The prototype specifications are largely defined by the anatomical constraints of the knee joint. The device must operate within a narrow bone gap, typically only a few millimetres wide, while still being capable of applying forces of up to 250N. This combination of small dimensions and large required forces presents significant engineering challenges in terms of size, material strength, and sensor placement. Therefore, all design decisions must carefully balance precision, compactness, and structural durability. A few of these engineering constraints are mentioned in the image below.

        <h2>5.2. Design 1: Mechanical Jack with Screw</h2>
        <p>
          The first concept to be prototyped employs a mechanical jack integrated with a lead-screw system to generate a force–displacement curve and identify the ligament’s “ideal force.” The lead screw enables precise control, where each rotation corresponds to a defined change in the joint gap, ensuring consistent and reproducible displacement measurements. The jack applies a smooth, evenly distributed force across the joint, preventing sudden jumps or uneven loading. Together, this setup allows accurate correlation between applied force and displacement, forming the basis for a reliable and repeatable force–displacement curve.

        <h2>5.3. Design 2: Springs</h2>
        <p>
          The next design selected for early prototyping is a <strong>spring-based motorised mechanism </strong>that generates a force–displacement curve to determine the ligament’s “ideal force.” The system consists of two thin, bone-shaped plates that are gradually pushed apart by a motor, increasing the load applied to the joint. A<strong> force sensor</strong> positioned between the plate and bone surface records the applied force, while an<strong> infrared displacement sensor </strong>mounted outside the joint measures the separation between the plates. Together, these measurements allow real-time construction of the force–displacement curve. The images below illustrate the basic embodiment of this concept.

        <h2>5.4. Design 3: Inflatables</h2>
        <p>
          Another proposed design explores the use of an <strong>inflatable actuator </strong>to generate controlled force within the knee joint. This concept also relies on the force–displacement curve to determine the “ideal force,” but replaces mechanical springs with a pressurised inflatable element. Since both the <strong>contact area </strong>of the inflatable and the <strong>internal pressure </strong>are known, the applied force can be calculated directly using F=P×A, allowing for precise and continuous force measurement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Displacement will be captured using the same sensor-based approach as in other concepts, with the option of integrating a <strong>Vernier calliper-style mechanism</strong> if higher measurement accuracy is required. The embodiment below demonstrates how the inflatable component interfaces with the joint space to deliver smooth, uniform expansion while enabling real-time force–displacement data collection.

          Moving forward, after we make the different prototypes we also aim to create a testing environment. The testing plan is structured in four progressive stages to ensure accuracy, safety, and clinical validity of the device. It begins with<strong> bench top calibration</strong> to verify sensor accuracy and graph generation, followed by <strong>pig knee testing </strong>to assess physiological realism and tissue safety. The <strong>cadaveric trial </strong>stage focuses on validating reproducibility and surgeon feedback in realistic surgical conditions. Finally, a <strong>clinical pilot</strong> will evaluate usability, surgeon correlation, and postoperative outcomes, ensuring the system’s readiness for real-world application. The image below explains what we are testing, how we will validate the results, and what success of the prototype looks like.

          The next phase of our project focuses on moving from concept to validation. We will begin by developing prototypes to test the different design concepts and identify the most effective approach. Following this, we will conduct testing on pig knees to evaluate performance and safety in a realistic biological setting (according to the roadmap given above). Additionally, we will participate in the Duke University study trip to gain expert insights and feedback.
